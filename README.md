## News site: For this project I did a news site about what's new in the world of Hollywood. 
I used flexbox for the header and a css grid layout for the news articles.

## The problem: I had so much trouble working with grid layout, especially applying some header elements in it. 
So by asking around I found it was easier to use flexbox for the header section so I then removed it from the grid container. If I had more time I would make more changes to the header using flexbox.
I also managed to find a way to better work with margins and paddings since this gave me a headache. By adding background colors and borders to elements it was easier to notice all changes that was made.
I started this project by going through the materials and watching the live sessions. I googled A LOT to learn more about flexbox and grid but I still need more time to work with these. 
Media queries were easier to pick up then learning about the different layout techniques.
